description: My attempt to justify scoffing at new rappers using Beautiful Soup
---

The gruelish semester is over! The last few weeks were busy w/ proving convergence or solving other difficult questions so I was 
glad for a little break post Christmas to code something. I enjoy listening to some hip-hop, and a rapper known as J. Cole recently
released an album. Lately, so many so called 'mumble-rappers' have emerged so I was excited to have someone I enjoyed putting out music.
Mumble-rappers have this title because people joke how they don't speak coherently during their songs and how they seem to just mumble
the same words over and over again (almost as if they have two choruses going on). With this in mind, I decided to see just how
repetitive these 'mumble rappers' are vs other 'elite' rappers (at least in my eyes). 

I wrote a script that accepts a rapper's name and his or her album. It then gets the links to each song's lyrics, scraps the number of unique words per song, and finally creates a Pandas dataframe. The driver function looks like this
{% highlight ruby %} rapperDriver('kendrick lamar', 'to pimp a butterfly') {% endhighlight %}

Additionally, I scrapped the song lengths from Wikipedia. This was actually the difficult part.
Since Wikipedia allows anyone to edit it's page, many of the album's pages have different formats - some of the info is stored in table, other's 
have the same type of information in an unordered list.. the labels are different, etc. Due to this, I pretty much made it work for the people
I was interested in, so it's not generalizable to any artist. 

1. The page that held each song's link included links to the album's cover, tracklist, etc. Thankfully, each link to a song
was accompanied by the track number (which the undesired links had question marks), so I just I just wrote a function called albumLen that helped me get links only accompanied by a track number.
2. The entire wikipedia thing. I had so many issues come up because there was not a consistent format for the album. My code only works if the album information is in a certain table format that fit my needs. If I try to make this into something cooler, like an app, then I'll need to make it more robust. Or find a better website that gives me song lengths.
3. I don't distinguish between who is rapping in the song. Artist like J. Cole, who is known for not have nyone featured on his albums are easy but others have features on practically every song. I can imagine someone more eloquent or orignal features one of the mumble rappers or vice versa and thus skewing my results.. but I think that's a very rare event.

Scaping tables w/ Python was a bit more of a pain compared to R in my opinion.. instead of 
{% highlight ruby %}tab = soup.find('table', {'class' : 'some class'})
for row in tab.findAll('tr')[some length]
  col = row.findAll('td')[some index if desired].text
  do cool stuff with col
  store col
{% endhighlight %}

I only had to do 
{% highlight ruby %} song_length <- read_html(url) %>% 
                html_node("some css selector") %>% 
                html_table(fill = TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}

But I'm sure there might be some issue regarding table format that Python excels in when scraping.

When plotting, I used Seaborn accompanied with adjustText, which is a really neat package inspired from
things like ggrepel in R. You can see it below. Now, onto some plots!

You can see all of Kendrick's songs are have at least 200 unique words. One thing that drives this is the fact that he has a mini monologue at the end of each song.. I could subtract it from each length but I thought the monologue fit and thus decided to keep it. I'm mostly impressed by his "For Free" track... 200+ unique words in about 2 minutes.

This is a much shorter album.. it seems he has one chorus heavy or repetitive song "Folding clothes" which clocks in at 5+ minutes but has less than 200 unique words. Most of the songs are pretty fleshed out lyrically though.

Mumble rapper number one.. quite literally. Almost all of his songs are under 200 unique words no matter their length. They're all pretty short though so I can't fault him too much.

Another very short album. None of these are over 200 words. I don't even know this guy to be honest..

Decided to pull out an 'old school' classic rapper. Most of his songs are pretty lengthy and have a good amount of unique words. This almost makes me think each song is more of a mini-story instead of multiple verses tha reiterate the same thing... but maybe that's just my dad talking :)

Ok. I can't fault the mumble rappers too much because their songs seems to be pretty short on average.. but thien again, this sample size is only 2. I could look at more (and probably will when offline), but I can say with the low unique number of words and the length of most tracks, their albums to initially seem to be the most shallow. This is probably why they're all over the radio..
