<h1>Hey, I'm Jarvis Miller</h1>

<p>
I just graduated from Rice University with a B.A. in Statistics and am now a first year at UofM's Stat PhD dept. 
I'm a relatively new addict to all things Data Science and making sure that what I do is computationally feasible and able to be interpreted by a non-technical body.
While being buring in homework, I try to take online courses related to computing and attempt small projects like this blog to put things into practice.
My research interests are pretty vague at this moment, but I'm learning towards something in the <i>networks</i> realm.</p>

<h3><center>
All in all, I'm passionate about data visualization and making complex things easier to digest.</center>

<p>If you want to reach out to me, you can find my email in the little widget on the left. I'm always happy to chat about what I love and hear others chat about what they love.</p>
